Hi, I am Lynn. Welcome to my website!

Now I am a phD candidate at the [Artificial Cognitive Systems](https://artcogsys.com){:target="\_blank"} lab, and my supervisors are Dr. Umut G√º√ßl√º and Prof. Dr. Marcel van Gerven. For my PhD project, I make use of artificial neural networks to gain deeper 
knowledge on neuronal properties in the visual cortex (specifically V1 and V4). I will do this by performing experiments (neurophysiological, psychopysics) and analyzing data by developing computational models. 

My previous internship projects were 
1) in the biophysics department under supervision of Prof. Dr. Richard van Wezel and Dr. Yagmur G√º√ßl√ºt√ºrk, where we were part of the [NESTOR ](https://nestor-sight.com/){:target="\_blank"} consortium which involved developing cortical visual prosthetics for restoring vision in blind people
and 2) at the Artificial Cognitive Systems lab where I focused on generating adversarial images targeting both deep learning models and the human visual system. From these internships, I ultimately learned how to use Python to make programs (experiments) and computer models (deep learning) which I look forward to use in my phD research. 

Next to research, I like to do active stuff such as rock climbing, windsurfing, swimming, and hiking. I also like to play the nintendo, which I currently am using to play Super Mario Sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è, Zelda BOTW ‚öîÔ∏è, and want to start playing Super Mario Odyssey üçâ soon.
