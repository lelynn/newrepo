Hi, I am Lynn. Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate at the [Artificial Cognitive Systems](https://artcogsys.com){:target="\_blank"} lab, and my supervisors are Dr. Umut G√º√ßl√º and Prof. Dr. Marcel van Gerven. During my PhD, I make use of artificial neural networks to gain deeper 
knowledge on neuronal properties in the visual cortex (specifically V1 and V4). I will do this by performing experiments (neurophysiological, psychopysics) and analyzing data by developing complex computational models. 

My previous projects were 
1) in the biophysics department under supervision of Prof. Dr. Richard van Wezel and Dr. Yagmur G√º√ßl√ºt√ºrk, where we were part of the [NESTOR ](https://nestor-sight.com/){:target="\_blank"} consortium which involved developing cortical visual prosthetics for restoring vision in blind people
and 2) at the Artificial Cognitive Systems lab where I focused on generating adversarial images targeting both deep learning models and the human visual system. 

Next to research, I like to do active stuff such as bouldering, windsurfing, swimming, and hiking. I also like video games, e.g. Super Mario Sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è, Zelda BOTW ‚öîÔ∏è, Hollow Knight üëª.
