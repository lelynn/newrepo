Hi, I am Lynn. Welcome to my website. 

I just completed my Master degree at the Radboud University in Medical Biology, specialized in Neuroscience. 
Now I am starting with my 4-year phD in the [Artificial Cognitive Systems](https://artcogsys.com){:target="\_blank"}  lab, where I make use of artificial neural networks to gain deeper 
knowledge on neuronal properties in the visual cortex (specifically V1 and V4). I will do this by performing experiments (neurophysiological, psychopysics) and analyzing data by developing computational models. 

My previous internship projects were 
1) in the biophysics department and part of the [NESTOR ](https://nestor-sight.com/){:target="\_blank"} consortium which involved developing cortical visual prosthetics for restoring vision in blind people
and 2) at the Artificial Cognitive Systems lab where I focused on generating adversarial images targeting both deep learning models and the human visual system. From these internships, I ultimately learned how to use Python to make programs (experiments) and computer models (deep learning) which I look forward to use in my phD research. 

Next to research, I like to do active stuff such as rock climbing, windsurfing, swimming, and hiking. I also like to play the nintendo, which I currently am using to play Super Mario Sunshine ☀️, Zelda BOTW ⚔️, and want to start playing Super Mario Odyssey 🍉 soon.
