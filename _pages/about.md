Currently finishing up my master thesis in the artificial intelligence department at the Donder's Institute and will start my PhD in July!  My current (short-term) goal is to successfully finish up my thesis and then afterwards I will put all my effort into making my PhD project as successful as possible. I am looking forward to learn many things from it, and contribute to science!

Next to research, I like to do some sporty stuff (climbing, windsurfing, swimming, etc.) and also I like animals more than anything! Specifically cute puppies such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/ans2i1/this_little_lad_just_came_home/){:target="\_blank"}. Thanks for visiting my page.
