Hello! Welcome to my random website. Funny that you're here. I am currently doing my master thesis in the artificial intelligence department at the Donder's Institute. I get excited about learning new things and I like to contribute to science! 

Next to research, I like to do some sporty stuff (climbing, windsurfing, swimming, etc.) and also I like animals more than anything! Specifically cute puppies such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/ans2i1/this_little_lad_just_came_home/){:target="\_blank"}. Thanks for visiting my page.
