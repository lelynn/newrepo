During the first intership, I was taking artificial intelligence classes. I was quite good at it and found it a lot of fun. Yagmur introduced me to the AI department and Umut, and there I started my second internship. This internship became way more technical than the first one. I am currently still working on this project. It is quite challenging for me since I have never done anything like this before. But I liked to be challenged.

 This project has allowed me to add way more things to my github account and also learn about the field of using deep learning to study the brain. I became very intrigued about this field and I want to stay in this area of research.
