Assisting in a research, where I ran the psychophysics experiments on humans, to test their imagination and their binocular rivalry has allowed me to learn some practical things. The PhD researcher wrote the program and did the data analysis herself, and I met up with the people and ran the experiments. Although it was not a challenging task, I was very happy to do it. Not only because it paid well, but also because I was learning new things and became familiar with the system. Since the project was for Artificial Intelligence research group at the Donder's I was introduced to a new side of the neuroscience field. So far I have mainly resided on the science faculty and now I get the chance to be involved in the social sciences faculty of the Donder's Institute also.
