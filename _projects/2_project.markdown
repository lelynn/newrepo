I was allowed to assist in a research. Here I ran the psychophysics experiments on humans, to test their imagination and their binocular rivalry. Richard has mentioned this concept a few times so I was already a little bit familiar with it on the theoretical side.

This assistantship allowed me to learn the practival things. The PhD researcher wrote the program herself and did the data analysis herself, but I met up with the people and ran the experiments. Although it was not very challenging, I was very happy to do it. Not only because it pays well, but also because I was learning new things. Since the project was for Artificial Intelligence research group at the Donder's I was introduced to a new side of the neuroscience field. So far I have mainly been focused on the science faculty and now I get the chance to be involved in the social sciences faculty also.
