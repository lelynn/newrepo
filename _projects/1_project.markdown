One of my first relevant projects that included alot of programming is the one I did in Richard van Wezel's lab. 

For my master, I had to do two internships, the first one I went to the biophysics department and asked if I could do a project there. Thankfully, Richard allowed me to be part of his group and introduced me to the Neuronal Stimulation for Recovery of Function (NESTOR) project where I became a part of.

My second supervisor was Yagmur, she was an Artificial Intelligence graduate and a postdoc in the biophysics department at the moment (Currently Assistant professor in the A.I. department).

For the first time, I decided to go with a very technical internship. My days consisted of googling things, reading things, installing things, but mainly GOOGLING things.

The first few weeks consisted of reading about the brain, learning about the brain, and brainstorming
with my brain. I had to think of a project.

As I learned more and more about the science of human vision, I gained more interest in the project. I was allowed to attend the meetings where the different researchers discussed and updated eachother about the project.
