One of my first relevant projects that included alot of programming was part of the Neuronal Stimulation for Recovery of Function (NESTOR) project.

My daily supervisor for this project became Dr. Yağmur Güçlütürk, she was an Artificial Intelligence expert and a postdoc in the biophysics department (Currently Assistant professor in the A.I. department). She was respsonsible for the video processing of the project and I had the task of working with human psychophysics experiment to test her algorithms.

For the first time, I had a quite technical project. My days consisted of googling things, reading things, installing things, but mainly GOOGLING things.

The first few weeks consisted of reading about the brain, learning about the brain, and brainstorming
with my brain. I had to think of a project.</div>



As I learned more and more about the science of human vision, I gained more interest in the project. I was allowed to attend the meetings where the different researchers discussed and updated eachother about the project. Eventually I did research on biological motion in phosphene vision, where I wrote my first psychophysics experiment, I wrote a [report]({{ site.url }}/assets/MasterThesis1_final.pdf){:target="\_blank"} on this project, and provide the [source code](https://github.com/lelynn/BiologicalMotionExperiment){:target="\_blank"}.

### What I learned

    Programming.
</div>

I learned alot. First of all, I learned programming. So I started off with Matlab and then moved onto Python to construct the experiment. I have to say it was quite tough but it also helped alot to do online courses such as [Reeborg's world](http://reeborg.ca/index_en.html){:target="\_blank"}, [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/){:target="\_blank"}, or [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/){:target="\_blank"}. These really helped me understood the basics of the computer language. I became more and more excited about learning Python.


 I eventually also followed a course called Neural Networks, which was taught by Prof. Dr. Marcel van Gerven. It became my favorite course :) (except for the fact that we had to work in groups). This course introduced me to a part of artificial intelligence in which I would eventually do my [final master internship]({{ site.url }}/projects/3_project) in, in Marcel's lab. 

Next to programming, I had the chance to present my poster at a few events (Dutch Neuroscience Meeting, Perceptionday, Donder's Sessions). So I learned to make a professional poster and present it.
