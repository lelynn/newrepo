Google colaboratory ([Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com){:target="\_blank"}) is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org){:target="\_blank"} environment provided by Google where you can make use of Google's CPU and GPU for free! 

Now there is also a Corgi and Kitty mode that they added for fun, which will allow animated corgis and/or kitties to walk over your screen :) I will make a blogpost on using google colab for beginners soon.
