# Installing Ubuntu

Since I have an nvidia GPU on my macbook pro, I have decided that I wanted to install Ubuntu. This would allow me to run Cupy and use the GPU for neural networks while using the Chainer framework.

### First time installing

After following a tutorial online on how to partition my harddrive and install ubuntu on my macbook properly, I was super happy to see this when booting up:

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog_img/ubuntu_loader.png" alt="" title="ubuntu_loading"/>
</div>

So my ultimate goal was to use cupy, which is supported by cuda 10.0 (or older), and cuda 10.0 or older is supported by Ubunutu 18.04.1 (or older). I didn't know this so I first installed the newest Ubuntu 18.04.2 and then after a while found out I couldn't install cuda 10.0 properly. This is because on the [cuda 10.0 installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/10.0/){:target="\_blank"}, it says I needed the kernel version 14.15.0 (and I had 124.18.0). I tried different things to fix this problem (such as changing the kernel version to an older version) before I finally resolved to reinstalling an older Ubuntu.  
<div class="alert alert-warning" role='alert'>
  Pretty much, I installed the wrong version of Ubuntu!
</div>

 When I installed [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/#download){:target="\_blank"} from it's home page it was 18.04. Little did I know that I needed 18.04.1 instead of 18.04.2! So yes, I decided to reinstall. 

### Second time installing

The second time I installed Ubuntu, I specifically chose the 18.04.2 version and finally was able to install cuda 10.0. However, I thought to myself, I wonder how it would look like if I changed my screen resolution... Since I had an extra screen connected, I decided to play around with the different resolution possibilities. 
<div class="alert alert-danger">
 Turns out changing the screen resolution made my whole screen black... and then green!
</div>


<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog_img/green_screen" alt="" title="ubuntu_loading"/>
</div>

Everytime I rebooted it turned completely black and green on both screens :'( I googled everywhere and tried all possible solutions that were offered on Stackoverflow. I was able to access the root terminal but still, but still nothing worked. I decided to install Ubuntu once again.

### Third time is the charm

I WAS SO ANNOYED AT THIS POINT. I started questioning whether I even still wanted to use Chainer anymore, perhaps it is easier to rewrite all my codes to PyTorch.. (probably it was and still is a good idea). But I thought, this is a good way to learn things. Besides, I already have put some time in this, might as well finish the job... So finally.. the third time installing Ubuntu, everything works. I was able to install cuda properly, and then cupy and then everything else. It was a relieving moment, to see I was able to import cupy into python. 

### UNTIL... 

<div class="alert alert-danger">
 OUT OF MEMORRY!
</div>

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog_img/out_of_memory.png" alt="" title="out of memory!!!/>
</div>

Until I realized my model architecture is way too heavy for my tiny GPU... OUT OF MEMORY!!  

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog_img/cryface.jpg" alt="" title="ubuntu_loading"/>
</div>

Well.... I guess I cannot do much about this. It is nice to know how to use my GPU I guess.. And perhaps one day I should buy an external GPU.. but they're not cheap. 

### Lessons learned

- Think twice or three times before installing the latest version of everything.
- Dont just change your screen resolution on ubuntu. 
- Everything you do you can learn from.
